In progress

# TODO

- [x] Resnet50 feature extraction + fusion
- [x] Text detection part
- [x] RoI rotate part
- [x] Text recognition part
- [x] Data generation

All of the above are now in place. The problem is the code is still very messy and poorly structured.
Given that the main project pipeline is working, next steps are:

- [ ] Clean and structure the code
- [ ] See if RoiRotatePart can be improved using affine transformation

Once above is finished:

- [ ] Data augmentation
- [ ] Training/testing pipelines
- [ ] Documentation
